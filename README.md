Sample Insights:
All columns are complete with no missing data.
Numerical data includes purchase amount, review rating, and previous purchases.
Categorical data provides insight into customer preferences, behaviors, and demographics.

1. Customer Segmentation:
Clustering Analysis: Use clustering techniques like K-means or hierarchical clustering to group customers based on their behaviors, such as purchase amount, frequency of purchases, and review ratings. This could help in identifying high-value customers, frequent shoppers, or customers who only make purchases during certain seasons.
Demographic Segmentation: Segment customers based on age, gender, location, and subscription status to identify trends in purchasing behavior across different demographic groups.
2. Purchase Behavior Analysis:
Item Purchase Trends: Analyze the most frequently purchased items by category, size, color, and season. This can help identify popular items and predict future demand.
Seasonal Trends: Investigate how purchase amounts and item categories vary across different seasons. For example, you could check if certain items like sweaters are bought more in the winter, or if certain colors are more popular during specific seasons.
Impact of Discounts and Promo Codes: Explore how often customers use promo codes and discounts, and how this affects the total purchase amount. This can provide insights into how promotions influence buying behavior.
3. Review Rating Analysis:
Sentiment Analysis: Use review ratings to understand customer satisfaction with items. You can correlate ratings with the item categories, payment methods, or shipping types to see if certain factors influence customer satisfaction.
Review Trends by Category: Determine if certain categories (e.g., clothing, footwear) tend to receive higher or lower ratings. This can provide valuable feedback for improving product offerings.
4. Loyalty Program Analysis:
Loyalty Program Impact: Compare the shopping behavior of customers who are subscribed to the loyalty program versus those who are not. For example, you could look at the average purchase amount, frequency of purchases, and number of previous purchases for each group.
Effectiveness of Loyalty Program: Investigate if customers who are part of the loyalty program tend to use more promo codes, or if they prefer certain payment methods or shipping types.
5. Payment and Shipping Preferences:
Preferred Payment Method: Analyze the most popular payment methods and how they correlate with other variables like frequency of purchases or location.
Shipping Type Preferences: Investigate if customers tend to choose express shipping more when using certain payment methods or if shipping preferences vary by season.
6. Predictive Modeling:
Purchase Prediction: Build a predictive model to forecast future purchases based on customer demographics, previous purchase history, and loyalty program status. You could use machine learning models like decision trees or random forests for this task.
Churn Prediction: Use customer data (e.g., frequency of purchases, review ratings, subscription status) to predict the likelihood of a customer unsubscribing from the loyalty program or ceasing to make purchases.
7. Correlation Analysis:
Customer Attributes and Purchase Amount: Investigate how factors like age, gender, and location correlate with the total purchase amount. This can help in understanding which customer groups are more likely to make larger purchases.
Discounts and Purchase Amount: Analyze if customers who use discounts or promo codes tend to spend more or less compared to those who donâ€™t.
8. Visualizations:
Heatmaps and Correlation Plots: Create heatmaps to visualize correlations between variables like age, purchase amount, and frequency of purchases.
Bar and Pie Charts: Use bar charts to show the distribution of items purchased by category, size, and color. Pie charts can be used to display the proportion of different payment methods or shipping types.
